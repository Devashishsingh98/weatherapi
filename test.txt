At dawn the city breathed
Not with lungs but with wires and whispers
Windows blinked awake one by one
Streets remembered the footsteps of yesterday
A boy stood on a rooftop
Holding a question he could not name
The sky was pale and undecided
Clouds drifted like unfinished thoughts
Somewhere a train horn cried
Somewhere a kettle began to sing
Time stretched itself thin
As if unsure where TO BEGIn
The boy closed his eyes
And the world leaned closer

He thought of stories hidden in cracks
Of names written in dust
Of promises made to the dark
Light slid along the edges of buildings
Birds argued over nothing
Wind carried the smell of rain
The city shifted its weight
Balancing past and future
The boy remembered his father’s voice
Low and steady like a bridge
He remembered his mother’s hands
Warm with unspoken courage
Memory pressed against his chest
Like a second heartbeat

Below him people moved
Each carrying invisible storms
A woman counted coins and hope
A man rehearsed forgiveness
A child dragged a stick through puddles
Writing maps to nowhere
Every life intersected silently
Like stars refusing to collide
The boy wondered if meaning was loud
Or if it lived in quiet places
Between breaths
Between decisions

Morning grew bolder
Shadows retreated reluctantly
The city’s pulse quickened
Screens lit up with borrowed dreams
The boy stepped back from the edge
Not away from fear
But toward possibility
He descended the stairs
Each step a small agreement with life

On the street he joined the current
Faces passed like unread books
He imagined opening them
Reading their secret chapters
At a corner a musician played
Notes bending the air
Coins fell like small approvals
The boy paused
Let the music rearrange him

Rain finally arrived
Soft at first
Then certain
Umbrellas bloomed like thoughts
The city darkened and glowed at once
Reflections doubled the world
Making everything feel infinite
The boy laughed quietly
Because for a moment
It was enough to be here

He walked until his shoes were heavy
Until the day felt earned
Clouds broke open
Light spilled without apology
Steam rose from the streets
As if the city exhaled relief
The boy looked up
Not for answers
But for continuity

Evening approached gently
Shops closed their eyes
Windows learned to shine again
The boy returned home
Carrying nothing visible
Yet full all the same
He wrote nothing down
But the story stayed
Etched in his way of walking
In how he greeted the night
In how he trusted tomorrow
And the city
Endlessly awake
Kept the rest of the tale
For anyone willing to listen
